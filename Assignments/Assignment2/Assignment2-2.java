         * Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number)
         * which has the largest sum and outprint its sum.
         *
         * Example 1:
         * Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
         * Output: 6
         * Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

         * Example 2:
         * Input: nums = [1]
         * Output: 1
